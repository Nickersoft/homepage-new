  Hi there! 👋🏻 I'm Tyler, a founder, designer, and developer living in Seattle. 
  
  I'm currently the co-founder of [Linguistic](https://linguistic.io), an AI-powered platform for digital language learning and immersion.
  Before that, I built software at a bunch of companies like Baseten and Coursera.
  
  Here you'll mostly find my writing, as well as where to find me elsewhere on
  the web.
